# ðŸ“¦ Queue and Stack in C++
# ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To study and implement Queue and Stack operations in C++ using arrays, and to understand their differences in terms of memory allocation, order of processing, and efficiency.

# ðŸ“š Theory
# Queue

A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. The element inserted first is the one removed first.

Front â†’ points to the first element.

Rear â†’ points to the last element.

Characteristics:

FIFO order

Insertion at rear, deletion at front

Overflow when full, underflow when empty

# Stack
A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The element inserted last is the one removed first.

Top â†’ points to the most recently inserted element.

Characteristics:

LIFO order

Insertion and deletion at top only

Overflow when full, underflow when empty

# ðŸ“‹ Algorithm for Queue
    Start
    
    Initialize front = -1, rear = -1, and define array arr[SIZE].
    
    Display menu with options:
    
    Enqueue
    Dequeue
    Display
    Peek
    Check if Empty
    Check if Full
    Size
    Clear
    Exit
    Repeat until Exit chosen:
    
    Read userâ€™s choice.
    Enqueue:
    
    If rear == SIZE - 1 â†’ Overflow.
    Else if front == -1 â†’ set front = 0.
    Increment rear, insert element at arr[rear].
    Dequeue:
    
    If front == -1 OR front > rear â†’ Underflow.
    Else print arr[front], increment front.
    If front > rear â†’ reset front = rear = -1.
    Display:
    
    If empty â†’ print message.
    Else traverse from front to rear and print elements.
    Peek:
    
    If empty â†’ print message.
    Else print arr[front].
    Check if Empty:
    
    If front == -1 OR front > rear â†’ Empty.
    Else Not Empty.
    Check if Full:
    
    If rear == SIZE - 1 â†’ Full.
    Else Not Full.
    Size:
    
    If empty â†’ 0.
    Else rear - front + 1.
    Clear:
    
    Reset front = rear = -1.
    Exit:
    
    Terminate program.
    End

# ðŸ“‹ Algorithm for Stack
    Start
    
    Initialize top = -1 and define array arr[MAX].
    
    Display menu with options:
    
    Push
    Pop
    Display
    Exit
    Repeat until Exit chosen:
    
    Read userâ€™s choice.
    Push:
    
    If top == MAX - 1 â†’ Overflow.
    Else increment top, insert element at arr[top].
    Pop:
    
    If top == -1 â†’ Underflow.
    Else print arr[top], decrement top.
    Display:
    
    If top == -1 â†’ Empty.
    Else traverse from top to 0 and print elements.
    Exit:
    
    Terminate program.
    Default:
    
    Print invalid choice.
    End

# ðŸš€ Applications
# Queue
CPU scheduling (Round Robin, FCFS)

Disk scheduling

Data buffering (IO buffers, print queue)

BFS in graphs

Order processing systems
# Stack
Expression evaluation (postfix, prefix)

Function call management (recursion)

Undo/Redo in editors

Backtracking algorithms

Browser history navigation

Parsing and compilation

# ðŸ§  Conclusion
Queue follows FIFO, useful for scheduling and buffering.

Stack follows LIFO, useful for recursion, parsing, and backtracking.

Both structures are fundamental in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and form the basis for advanced applications like expression evaluation, graph traversal, and memory management.
